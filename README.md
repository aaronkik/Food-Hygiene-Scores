# Food Hygiene Scores

A Java Android app for one of my final year modules (Mobile Application Development) which scored 96%.

The app interacts with the [Food Hygiene Rating Scheme API](https://api.ratings.food.gov.uk/Help/Index).

Users can provide their device location to search for nearby establishments or search by address.

The app also implements Android Room to allow users to save and delete establishments on their local device.

An has also been implemented for users on larger devices.
